# Quickstart

Zero to a running MongrelDB Ruby program in fifteen minutes. This guide assumes
a fresh machine and walks through installing the prerequisites, starting the
daemon, and writing, running, and understanding a complete program.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

You need two things installed: the Ruby toolchain and a `mongreldb-server`
daemon.

### Install Ruby 3.0 or newer

MongrelDB Ruby is standard-library only, so any recent Ruby works. Verify it:

```sh
ruby -v
# ruby 3.x.x ...
```

If you do not have it, install from <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/>
or your package manager (e.g. `pacman -S ruby`, `brew install ruby`).

### Install mongreldb-server

Fetch a prebuilt server binary from the
[MongrelDB releases](https://github.com/visorcraft/MongrelDB/releases):

```sh
mkdir -p bin
curl -fsSL -o bin/mongreldb-server \
  https://github.com/visorcraft/MongrelDB/releases/download/v0.58.3/mongreldb-server-linux-x64
chmod +x bin/mongreldb-server
```

Verify it runs:

```sh
./bin/mongreldb-server --version
```

## 2. Start the daemon

By default `mongreldb-server` listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8453` and stores
data in the current working directory.

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/mdb-data && cd /tmp/mdb-data
/path/to/mongreldb-server
```

In another terminal, sanity-check it:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8453/health
# ok
```

Leave the daemon running for the rest of this guide.

## 3. Create a project and pull in the client

```sh
gem install mongreldb
```

Or add it to a Gemfile and run `bundle install`:

```ruby
# Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "mongreldb"
```

## 4. Write your first program

Create `demo.rb`:

```ruby
require "mongreldb"

# 1. Connect to the daemon. Empty/omitted URL falls back to http://127.0.0.1:8453.
db = MongrelDB::Client.new(url: "http://127.0.0.1:8453")

# 2. Health check before doing anything else.
unless db.health
  warn "daemon not reachable"
  exit 1
end

# 3. Create a table. Each column has a stable numeric id, a name, a type, and
#    flags. The first column is the primary key.
tid = db.create_table("orders", [
  { "id" => 1, "name" => "id",       "ty" => "int64",   "primary_key" => true,  "nullable" => false },
  { "id" => 2, "name" => "customer", "ty" => "varchar", "primary_key" => false, "nullable" => false },
  { "id" => 3, "name" => "amount",   "ty" => "float64", "primary_key" => false, "nullable" => false },
])
puts "created table id: #{tid}"

# 4. Insert rows. Cells maps column id -> value. nil means "no idempotency key".
db.put("orders", { 1 => 1, 2 => "Alice", 3 => 99.5 })
db.put("orders", { 1 => 2, 2 => "Bob",   3 => 150.0 })

# 5. Query with a native index condition. The range index serves this in
#    sub-millisecond. Projection selects only column ids 1 and 2.
rows = db.query("orders")
  .where("range", "column" => 3, "min" => 100.0)
  .projection([1, 2])
  .limit(100)
  .execute
rows.each { |row| puts "row: #{row.inspect}" }

# 6. Count the rows.
puts "total rows: #{db.count('orders')}"
```

Run it:

```sh
ruby demo.rb
```

You should see:

```
created table id: 1
row: {"1"=>2, "2"=>"Bob"}
total rows: 2
```

## 5. What each part does

| Code | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `MongrelDB::Client.new(url)` | Builds an HTTP client targeting one daemon. Safe to share across threads. |
| `db.health` | GET `/health`; returns `true` when the daemon answers. Always check before real work. |
| `db.create_table(name, cols)` | POST `/kit/create_table`. Column `id`s are the on-wire identifiers; use them everywhere else. |
| `db.put(table, cells)` | Single-op transaction: POST `/kit/txn` with one `put` op. `cells` is flattened to `[col_id, val, ...]`. |
| `db.query(table).where(...)` | Builds a `/kit/query` body. `where` pushes a condition down to a native index. |
| `.projection([1, 2])` | Server returns only those column ids, saving bandwidth. |
| `.limit(100)` | Caps the result; check `q.truncated` afterward to detect overflow. |
| `.execute` | Sends the query and decodes the `rows` array. |
| `db.count(table)` | GET `/tables/{name}/count`. |

## 6. Typed columns: enums and defaults

The column hashes passed to `create_table` are forwarded to the daemon
verbatim, so any column-level constraint the engine supports is just another
key in the hash. Two useful ones:

- `enum_variants` (`Array<String>`) - restricts an `enum` column to a fixed
  set of string values. The engine rejects writes that fall outside the set.
- `default_value` (`String`, `Integer`, etc.) - the value written into the
  column when a row omits it. The engine-side default is applied before any
  client-side default.
- `default_expr` (`"now"` or `"uuid"`) - a dynamic server-side default.

Literal `"now"` and `"uuid"` strings are expressed through `default_value`
like any other static string; use `default_expr` only when you want the dynamic
server-side behavior.

Supply `default_value` using the JSON scalar type expected by the column.

```ruby
db.create_table("orders", [
  { "id" => 1, "name" => "id",     "ty" => "int64",   "primary_key" => true,  "nullable" => false },
  { "id" => 2, "name" => "status", "ty" => "enum",
    "enum_variants" => ["draft", "active", "archived"],
    "default_value" => "draft",
    "primary_key" => false, "nullable" => false },
  { "id" => 3, "name" => "amount", "ty" => "float64",
    "default_value" => 0,
    "primary_key" => false, "nullable" => false },
])

# Omitting the status column falls back to the engine-side default ("draft").
db.put("orders", { 1 => 1, 3 => 99.50 })
```

Keys that are not set on a column are omitted from the request body - no
`null` placeholders are sent. The wire-shape conformance test at
[`spec/create_table_wire_shape_spec.rb`](../spec/create_table_wire_shape_spec.rb)
guards these keys against silent renames.

## 7. History retention and time travel

MongrelDB keeps a durable MVCC history window. You can inspect it, widen it,
and query older epochs with `AS OF EPOCH`.

```ruby
puts db.history_retention_epochs   # current window, e.g. 100
puts db.earliest_retained_epoch    # oldest readable epoch, e.g. 3

# Widen the window. The response contains the updated values.
resp = db.set_history_retention_epochs(1_000)
puts resp["history_retention_epochs"]   # => 1000

# Read the table as it existed at epoch 5.
rows = db.sql("SELECT id, amount FROM orders AS OF EPOCH 5")
```

Increasing retention cannot restore history that has already been pruned. The
window is a durable GC/time-travel policy, so it requires admin privileges when
the daemon is running with auth.

## 8. Common pitfalls

**Using the column name instead of the column id.** Every on-wire API uses the
numeric `id` from `create_table`, never the `name`. The query builder's
`column` alias maps to the server's `column_id` - pass the integer id, not the
string name:

```ruby
# Wrong:
.where("range", "column" => "amount", "min" => 100.0)
# Right:
.where("range", "column" => 3, "min" => 100.0)
```

**Treating a single `put` as non-transactional.** `put` is a one-op
transaction. A unique constraint violation surfaces as a `ConflictError`
(HTTP 409), not as a silent no-op.

**Calling `commit` twice on the same `Transaction`.** The second call raises
`RuntimeError: transaction already committed`. Create a fresh
`db.begin_transaction` for each logical unit of work.

**Reusing a `QueryBuilder` and expecting a fresh `truncated`.** `truncated`
reflects the most recent `execute`. Build a new query, or re-run `execute`
before reading it.

**Expecting `sql` to always return rows.** The `/sql` endpoint streams Arrow
IPC for `SELECT` in most builds, so `sql` returns an empty array (not an
error) for result sets. Use it for DDL/DML and statements whose success is the
signal; use the native query builder for typed row retrieval.

**Pointing at a daemon that requires auth.** If the daemon was started with
`--auth-token` or `--auth-users`, every call raises `AuthError` unless you pass
`token:` or `username:`/`password:`. See [auth.md](auth.md).

## Next steps

- [transactions.md](transactions.md) - atomic batches, idempotency, retries
- [queries.md](queries.md) - every native index condition
- [sql.md](sql.md) - recursive CTEs, window functions, `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`
- [auth.md](auth.md) - bearer tokens, basic auth, user/role management
- [errors.md](errors.md) - the full error hierarchy and recovery patterns
